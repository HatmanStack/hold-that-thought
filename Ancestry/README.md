# Ancestry Tree Exporter

Chrome extension that exports person data from Ancestry.com family trees directly to clean JSON files.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this directory
4. Log into Ancestry.com in your browser

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon → "Open Exporter in New Tab"
2. Either:
   - **Load a GEDCOM file**: Select a `.ged` exported from Ancestry to auto-populate Tree ID and Person IDs
   - **Manual entry**: Enter Tree ID and comma-separated Person IDs
3. Set delay between pages (5-30 seconds recommended to avoid rate limiting)
4. Click "Start Export"

## How It Works

For each person, the extension:

1. **Facts page** → Extracts person metadata, timeline events, and family relationships
2. **Story page** → Extracts narrative summary and detailed event descriptions
3. **Gallery page** → Extracts media metadata (image URLs, titles)

Data is parsed inline from the DOM - no intermediate HTML files are saved.

## Output

Creates `ancestry_export/{personId}.json` for each person (~2KB each):

```json

## Download Images

Use the included script to download images after export:

```bash
node download-images.js [export-dir] [output-dir] [cookies-file]
node download-images.js ./ancestry_export ./images ./cookies.json
```

**Cookies file**: Export your Ancestry cookies as JSON to authenticate downloads:

```json
[
  { "name": "authentication", "value": "...", "domain": ".ancestry.com" }
]
```

Use a browser extension like "EditThisCookie" or "Cookie-Editor" to export cookies.

## Finding Your Tree ID

Your Tree ID is in the URL when viewing your tree:

```
https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/176147288/family
                                         ^^^^^^^^^ Tree ID
```

Or load your GEDCOM file - the Tree ID is extracted automatically.
