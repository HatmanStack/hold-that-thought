# Summer at the Lake House

Dear Family,

The summer heat has finally arrived, and with it, our annual retreat to the lake house. The children are beside themselves with excitement - little Tommy has already caught three fish, though he let them all go saying they "deserved to swim free."

The garden is flourishing this year. The tomatoes are coming in beautifully, and I've been putting up preserves every afternoon. Your father has been working on the old dock, determined to have it ready for the Fourth of July celebration.

I wanted to write while these moments are fresh. Someday, when the children are grown with families of their own, I hope they'll remember these simple summers - the smell of pine, the sound of loons at dusk, the way the sunlight dances on the water in the early morning.

With all my love,
Mother
