To My Beloved Family,

As I sit by the fire this Christmas Eve, watching the snow fall gently outside, my heart is full of gratitude. This year has brought its challenges, but looking around at all of you gathered here, I am reminded of what truly matters.

Little Sarah asked me today what Christmas was like "in the old days." I told her about the orange in my stocking that felt like the greatest treasure, about singing carols by candlelight, about my mother's apple pie cooling on the windowsill.

But I also told her that the best parts haven't changed - family gathered together, stories shared, love passed down from generation to generation.

May this letter find you all in good health and spirits. Hold tight to each other, for family is the greatest gift we'll ever receive.

Your loving father and grandfather,
Walter
