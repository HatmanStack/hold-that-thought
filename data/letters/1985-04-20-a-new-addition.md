Dearest Family,

I'm writing to share the most wonderful news - our baby girl arrived this morning at 7:23 AM. Seven pounds, four ounces, with a shock of dark hair and the most perfect tiny fingers you've ever seen.

We've named her Elizabeth, after grandmother. When I look at her, I can already see the family resemblance - she has her great-grandmother's determined chin and her grandfather's curious eyes.

The doctors say everything went smoothly, and I'm recovering well. David hasn't stopped smiling since he held her for the first time. He's already planning which bedtime stories to read her (starting with all the ones his mother read to him, of course).

There's something profound about becoming a parent - suddenly, you understand your own parents in a way you never could before. All those sleepless nights, all that worry, all that boundless love - now I get it.

We can't wait for you all to meet her.

With overwhelming joy,
Margaret & David
