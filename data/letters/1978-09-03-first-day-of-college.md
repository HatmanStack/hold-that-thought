Mom and Dad,

Well, I made it! The dorm room is smaller than my closet at home, and my roommate snores like a freight train, but I'm here. College. Can you believe it?

I know you're worried about me being so far from home. I am too, if I'm honest. But walking across campus today, seeing all these people from all over the country, all of us starting something new together - it felt like the beginning of something important.

I promise to call every Sunday (if I can get to the payphone before the line forms). I promise to study hard and make you proud. And I promise that no matter how far I go or how much I learn, I'll never forget where I came from.

Thank you for everything you sacrificed to give me this chance. I won't waste it.

Your son,
Robert
